### Security & Privacy Made Simple
All notes are encrypted and data never leaves your device without your permission. There are no trackers, no ads, and no intrusive device permissions. We do not collect, sell, or share your information since Incognoto is entirely free and open source.

### Safely Backup Anywhere
For when lifeâ€™s accidents happen, you can rest assured that your data is available only to you. Store encrypted backups on any cloud while keeping your data locked behind your own password. Incognoto has zero knowledge of your notes so if you lose your password then we are not able to recover any data.

### Advanced Authentication
By default your data is encrypted using a cryptographically secure generated password. With options for a custom password, biometrics, or a hardware key, Incognoto offers the most advanced security standards.

### Free & Open Source
   Peer reviewed code under a GPLv2 license. Security nerds approve.
   
### Minimal Footprint
   With an app size of around 400kB and low memory usage, Incognoto is lightweight and lightning fast on any device.
   
### Incognito Mode
   Blocks screenshots and hide content when you switch between apps.
   
### Quick Search & Filters
   Use #Hashtags, words, or phrases to find notes.
